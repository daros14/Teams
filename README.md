Description:

This simple Android material design app lets you get all the information from basketball teams, such as office address, jersey colours or even launching google with the location of the arena. By loading its data from several values.xml defined inside the app, you can create almost an app for every need you have. Could be local football teams, local groceries, post offices, anything you need to get the info in a quick way without having internet connection.

Please do not forget to change my Google Maps API KEY for the one you generate. You can follow the tutorial made by google to create your own key and credentials: https://developers.google.com/console/help/new/?hl=es#creating-android-api-keys

Hope you enjoy it. Let me know any bug! Thanks, David.
